Ohmite 15FR200E
0.2 ohms 5W 1%

Temperature coefficient is about 50ppm/C and 40C/Watt
Max power dissipated is 0.2*3*3 = 1.8W
==> Max temp rise in free air = 1.8 * 40 = 72 degrees
==> resistor will be about 100C max
==> 50000 ppm = 0.5% diff ==> OK

Performance will be better if using fan to cool resistor
