# The Lab PSU Project
======================


## About
The lab PSU project consists of electronic schematics and software for a basic constant voltage/constant current lab power supply unit. It is a hobby project started by me in March 2013, to put some of the theory I learned about electronics into practice.

The project is still in development, and at the moment is just barely useable!

## Harware characteristics
The PSU's hardware characteristics are:
* Max voltage: 15V, in 5mV steps
* Max current: 3A, in 1mA steps
* Fully linear
* Microcontroller driven
* Quite fool-proof: it should not blow up when used incorrectly


## Software characteristics
The PSU's software characteristics are:
* Fast (10 Hz) and accurate (15 bit) voltage and current readings
* Manual calibration of ADC
* Auto calibration and non-linearity compensation of DAC
* Error logging and reporting
* Proper software design and documentation
