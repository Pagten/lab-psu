3 Buttons:
1) Output on/off
2) Display
3) Menu

2 Rotary encoders (including buttons):
1) Voltage
2) Current


Normal mode - view 1
----------------------
|  | Voltage Current |
|CV|  12.18V  2.485A |
|CC|  10.89V  2.485A |
|ON|     27.06W      |
----------------------
Set values can be locked/unlocked by pressing and holding the corresponding
rotary encoder. A lock symbol is displayed below V/A when the voltage/current
is locked.



Normal mode - view 2
----------------------
|  |/| /|  /| /| \ / |
|CV| |  | . |  |  \  |
|CC|/| /|  /| /|  /  |
|ON| |  | . |  | / \ |
----------------------
Normally displays measured V/A, switches to set values in blinking font when
corresponding rotary encoder is rotated. Set values can be locked/unlocked by
pressing and holding the corresponding rotary encoder. A lock symbol is
displayed to the right of the V/A when the voltage/current is locked.


Menu
----------------------
|  | Status          |
|CV| ADC calibration |
|CC| DAC calibration |
|ON| Message log     |
----------------------
Can scroll through rows using either rotary encoder. Highlighted row is in
inverted font. Can select row by clicking either rotary encoder. Set voltage or
current does not change while in the main menu. Pressing menu or view button
will exit the main menu.


Menu --> ADC calibration confirmation
----------------------
|  |ADC calibration  | (inverted font)
|CV|Voltage: OK  Cal |
|CC|Current: OK  Cal |
|ON|             Back|
----------------------
Back is highlighted by default, either Cal can be highlighted by rotating either
rotary encoder. Pressing the menu button will return to the main menu (same as
back). Pressing the view button will exit the menu and go back to the previous
view. V/A Cal or Back can be selected by pressing either rotary encoder.
Selecting V/A Cal will start the corresponding V/A ADC calibration process.

Menu --> DAC calibration confirmation
----------------------
|  |DAC calibration  | (inverted font)
|CV|Voltage: OK  Cal |
|CC|Current: OK  Cal |
|ON|             Back|
----------------------
Back is highlighted by default, either Cal can be highlighted by rotating either
rotary encoder. Pressing the menu button will return to the main menu (same as
back). Pressing the view button will exit the menu and go back to the previous
view. V/A Cal or Back can be selected by pressing either rotary encoder.
Selecting V/A Cal will start the corresponding V/A DAC calibration process.
